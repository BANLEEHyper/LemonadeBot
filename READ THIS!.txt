Congratulations on purchasing Steven Lemonade Instagram Bot! In this document, I will go through with you the downloading and operating process of this bot,
as well as giving you some advice and how you should use this tool. WARNING: The downloading process is complicated, so feel free to contact me on instagram @lemonade_records

3. Right click on the python file that is titled 'Bot', and click 'open with visual studio code'

4. In the code, there should be a section where you can enter your username and password, as well as the type of hashtag you want to start commenting in. 
There should also be a command for how many times you want to comment per round. I reccomend not going over 40, for going beyond that number may cause 
instagram to ban you

5. Enjoy your bot!

*If you are having trouble installing the bot, Feel free to email us sangholee0202@gmail.com . We will install it for you for an additional fee of $5
